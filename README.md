 # Student Churn Analysis

## 📑 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing student churn (dropout) patterns to identify factors contributing to student retention and attrition. The analysis helps educational institutions implement data-driven interventions to improve retention rates. The project covers data processing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, model building, and actionable insights.

## 🎯 Objectives

- **Identify Key Factors**: Determine the most significant factors leading to student dropout.
- **Predictive Modeling**: Build a model to predict the likelihood of a student dropping out.
- **Provide Actionable Insights**: Offer recommendations to improve student retention rates.

## 🗂️ Dataset

The dataset includes information on student demographics, academic performance, attendance, and engagement metrics. It typically contains the following columns:

- **Student ID**: Unique identifier for each student
- **Age**: Age of the student
- **Gender**: Gender of the student
- **GPA**: Grade Point Average
- **Attendance Rate**: Attendance percentage for the term
- **Family Income**: Estimated family income bracket
- **Parental Education**: Level of education of the student's parents
- **Engagement Level**: Measure of engagement in extracurriculars or class participation
- **Churn**: Target variable indicating whether the student has dropped out (1) or not (0)

> **Note**: Ensure data privacy and compliance with educational data regulations if working with real data.

## 🔧 Tools and Technologies

- **Python**: For data processing and model building.
- **Pandas & NumPy**: Data manipulation and preparation.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: Visualization for EDA.
- **Scikit-Learn**: Building and evaluating predictive models.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Code development and documentation.

## 📊 Methodology

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Clean and handle missing values.
   - Encode categorical variables.
   - Standardize/normalize numerical features where necessary.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Analyze dropout rates across different demographic and performance metrics.
   - Visualize distributions and correlations to understand key factors.

3. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Create new features, such as engagement score, based on existing metrics.
   - Experiment with transformations and feature selection techniques.

4. **Modeling**:
   - Test multiple models (Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, etc.).
   - Perform hyperparameter tuning to improve model performance.
   - Evaluate models using metrics like Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and AUC-ROC.

5. **Insights & Recommendations**:
   - Interpret the model outputs and identify high-impact factors.
   - Recommend targeted interventions for at-risk students.

## 🔍 Results

- **Model Performance**: Brief summary of the best-performing model and its metrics.
- **Key Insights**: Summary of the main factors impacting student churn.
- **Recommendations**: Suggestions for retention improvement based on analysis (e.g., increased support for students with low engagement or attendance).
